    <div class="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2><br>
        <p>
            We were provided with the assingments to design the personal portfolio using HTML5 and CSS3. In this term we were taught about HTML and CSS3, the
            knowledge we gained from the sessions are subjected to be utilized in this project.To develop the project, first i did reserach on the personal portfolios available on web. I compared different sites, grabbed ideas from them, and make an concept to design my portfolio. After that, i started  creating the wireframes for the pages. Compleating the wireframes, i started to code for the designs.

        <h2>UI Design Decision</h2><br>
        <p> Deciding the final UI is always challenging fo the Web developers. When i visited different sites to get some good color combination and designes,i found some  sites  with very unfriendy colors. These types of color combination irritartes the user. Sometime unfriendly colorcombinations makes users to close the site. To avoid the unfriendly interference,i decided to choose light black color for the navigation background with the white font color which made it clearly visible.
        In the main content section the background picture with light yellow and grey is helping the black text to make it clearly visible. To make the site more attractive, i had choosen the animation on footer section with simple colors. To make the practice of google material design, animations, hover effects, shadow on the image and box are used. </p><br>

    <div class="wireframe">
        
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <br>
        <p> Wireframes are the blurprints or outline for the for the design, which simply defines the placement of the site, featuress and navigations for websites. As the bluprints defines the placements of plumbing, electrical and others structural elements without interior designs,it also defines the structural placements of the contents without designs.At first the wireframes are created of each pages that are neeeded to be designed.
        Every pages contain Navigation bar, footer, section, search bar and titles accourdingly.In 
        section the contents differ accourdingly as different pages. creating the wireframes before 
        designing the site madkes the developer easy to create the design accourding to it.

        <h2>My experencies</h2><br>
        <p>
        This was the first time i have ever designed the site. Overall it was challenging  for me to  create it. Initally it was hard for me, but the study and research on web devlopment eased me to do the task. When i started designing the site, i thought i can do it easily, but i faced many problems regarding designing the sites. I took my study on HTML and CSS and the assingments task throughly. Together it helped me to solve the problems more easily and convinentely. It also helped me to sumup the knowledes on HTML and CSS. During this Term and this task solving period, i learned many things regarding web development. Befor i didnt  had enough knowledge to design a website, but now i can confidently say that i can be a web developer in future and i can  also design a site. After completion of the design phase ,  i knew the basic concept of material designs, basic concepts of HTML and CSS, Mobile responsives, present context of Web development ans the stardards of the websites. </p><br>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <br>        
        <p> Validation is the prosses of ensuring the webpages to confirm the standards, check the errors on the site.
        Validating the website ensures the standards and norms and makes the website standard aand universally understood.
        Validators detect problems in the webpage and style sheets. Some problems like, open tages which are not closed, misplaced tags and commands can be detected and notified where is the error, which makes easy to find it and solve it 
        There are many validation sites  through which we can validate the site, to validate my site,i choose W3.org validator. Screenshots after the validation process are mentioned below. Less eroors were detected on the sites except social.html page. After validating the sites itried to solve the possible solutions.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>To sum up, we were provided with the assingment to Design the personal portfolio. This assignment provided me a  chance to gather alot of information about HTML and CSS and make the basic concepts clear about it. It also helped me to develop the concept of Material Designs. I learned to design thesites using CSS propertiels like mediaqueries, animations, shadows in this assignments. I created a simplesite with the navbar main section and footer. Main Content contains more than one div. the page is supposed to be mobile responsive. Homepage contains an animated footer, an animated Picture with hover effects and the attractive navigatin bar. In the about page, there ae two columns, one for the text  and another for picture. In contacts page it is designed as the form submition to contact. To make it easy for address map is added. Social page contains % boxes through which user can view my social media profiles. Social page is fully responsive, animation in all pages worked very well. All the pages are device  responsive, some are ont workinng it properly. If there was more time i would have worked more on it to make it more attractive. Overall this project was too much helpful for me to build concepts on web devlopment. </p><br>
